It's not difficult to start new things. It's just that the human mind is an incredible machine that has a habit of overthinking things. This means that we are often clear about what we need to do to get started, but at the same time we are prevented from diving in head first by a wall that shows us everything that can go wrong and all the mass of work we will have to do.

A good dose of planning is important indeed. Another dose of preparation and study is also important. But then the brain decides to take many doses of caution and rework (before the work even begins). That's where's the graveyard of projects that died before they started.

This site is an experiment. As such, I feel entitled to be flexible and careless about certain things, especially when it comes to appearances. Even then, I've been overly careful about how things work and have put off starting for months.

One thing I really appreciate about my father is his ability to visualise exactly how he wants a certain project to be executed. The difference between us is that his preparation period is much shorter, and he starts the execution right away. In the middle of the process he may say "this is not exactly how I imagined it" and rework that part. But more often than not, in a certain milestone of the project he says that this is exactly how he visualised it.

I can't say I have a clear vision of how I want this project to work. But I finally broke down part of the mental barrier that was stopping me from getting started. I realized that showing my work - even if incomplete, imperfect, uninteresting and without a hundred percent defined purpose or direction - is the most important thing now. And then we can work together afterwards.
