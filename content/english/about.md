## My personal life

I'm 24 years old and live in São Paulo, Brazil. I love progressive metal and EDM. I play the [guitar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgpF-5cEExs) and the drums, and I like to make some stuff with leather from time to time.

Most of my hobbies and skills are centered around computers - this website and the way I created it are proof of that. I currently have a self-improvement project focused on broadening my world view, getting mental clarity on some topics, learning new things, and making friends along the way. This website will be, among other things, a documentation of my progress and evolution on this project.

## My professional life

I started working on IT in 2018 as a support analyst (in theory) and full-fledged SysAdmin (in practice). I learnt a lot about servers and networks (specially Windows servers and the **joy** that is working with them). I learnt how to assist people on-site or remotely. I learnt to *solve problems* and I got particularly good at that. I knew nothing from the start, but when I left now in 2021, people were insisting for me to stay.

I actually left without a proposal from another company, which everybody thinks is a bit crazy. I regret nothing. I had to do this for mental health and peace of mind, which is something that most recruiters nowadays should respect when seeing a *gap* on a candidate's résumé. Hope I don't scare anyone with this absurdity. I had some money saved so I could afford this leave with zero weight on my shoulders and no fear of the future.

Obviously I wasn't just messing around on the months I didn't work. I studied Salesforce for some time and became a [ranger on TrailHead](https://trailblazer.me/id/patrickcamillo). Though I felt that this was not the path I should take for now (even though I liked the platform's possibilities). That's when I decided to focus my energy on studying **DevOps**. My articles about this theme should serve as a good example of what I know about this world.

There's no denying that one of the reasons that made me leave the other company was the fact that I had to work with Windows, which seems make the SysAdmin work harder on purpose. My passion is on Linux since I started working and began to experiment at home. I built a [home server](/en/blog/home-server) and took a good portion of the knowledge I acquired with it to work. Linux is a big deal on the world of DevOps and I have plenty of stuff to talk about it on its own, even though I haven't worked that much with it. See all the posts tagged with [tech](/en/tags/tech) for an overview of my articles about IT.

## Further considerations

On this website, you can expect to see articles about some other themes I want to explore, be it related to work or not:

- Life and the human beings as complex creatures;
- Technology: programming, Linux, and electronics;
- Photography and audiovisual content production;
- Music and;
- Complaint about the world's situation (ok, maybe not).

Almost every post will have a comment section. Let's talk! It's always healthy to learn from each other, so I really encourage you to leave a comment on the posts you visit. You can also talk directly to me via [e-mail](mailto:patrick.camillo@outlook.com). Let me know if I can do anything for you.
