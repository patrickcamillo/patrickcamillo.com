## My personal life

I'm 27 years old and live in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. I love progressive metal and play a little bit of [guitar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgpF-5cEExs). I enjoy making some stuff with leather from time to time, and love to cook at home.

Most of my hobbies and skills are centered around computers - this website and the way I created it are evidence of that. I currently have a self-improvement project focused on broadening my world view, getting mental clarity on some topics, learning new things, and making friends along the way. This website will be, among other things, a documentation of my progress and evolution on this project.

## My professional life

I started working on IT in 2018 as a support analyst (in theory) and full-fledged SysAdmin (in practice). I learnt a lot about servers and networks (specially Windows servers and the **joy** of working with them). I learnt how to assist people on-site or remotely. I learnt to *solve problems* and I got particularly good at that. I knew nothing from the start, and I still learn something new almost on a daily basis.

I studied Salesforce for some time and became a [ranger on TrailHead](https://trailblazer.me/id/patrickcamillo). Though I felt that this was not the path I should take for now (even if I liked the platform's possibilities), I'm still considering migrating to that area. I'm also studying **DevOps** and enhancing my software develompent skills on some projects that I'm yet to release a MVP on GitHub. Stay tuned to that.

My passion is on Linux since I started working and began to experiment at home. I built a [home server](/en/blog/home-server) and took a good portion of the knowledge I acquired with it to work. Linux is a big deal on the world of DevOps and I have plenty of stuff to talk about it on its own, even though I haven't worked that much with it. See all the posts tagged with [tech](/en/tags/tech) for an overview of my articles about technology.

## Further considerations

On this website, you can expect to see articles about some other themes I want to explore, be it related to work or not:

- Life and the human beings as complex creatures;
- Technology: programming, Linux, and electronics;
- Photography and audiovisual content production;
- Music;
- Cooking some tasty food and;
- Leatherworking and my complicated relationship with artistic processes.

In principle, all my posts will have comments. I apologise for requiring a GitHub login to comment, but it's the best way I've found for now. It's always good to exchange ideas, so I really encourage you to say something about the posts you see.
