Hi! My name is Patrick.

I live in São Paulo/Brasil. I'm passionate about technology (I study and write about it), music, books, leatherworking and deep conversations about life. Read my [about](/en/about) page for more.

You can find me on these networks, if that's your thing:

Visitors are more than welcome to check out my [articles and projects](/en/blog) and tell me their opinion about them on the comments. This is supposed to be a two-way street, and both me and you can learn something from our interactions.

Please note that my main language is Portuguese. I do intend to translate all of my posts to English, but I might take a while to do so.
